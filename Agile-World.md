# Agile World

You work in the IT Department of a medium to large company that has
traditionally been successful in the market, but for the last several years it
has been struggling. They've transitioned to Scrum because they heard that
scrum was the best way to do agile, and agile was the best way to run IT, but
it doesn't seem to have really changed anything.

## Characters

### Role

You're a member of a Scrum team, so pick one of the positions on the team:

#### Developer

[TK: credit these descriptions from https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-team]

Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any
aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.

The specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with
the domain of work. However, the Developers are always accountable for:

* Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;
* Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;
* Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,
* Holding each other accountable as professionals.

##### Product Owner

The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product
resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. How this is done may vary widely
across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.

The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management,
which includes:

* Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;
* Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;
* Ordering Product Backlog items; and,
* Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.

The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to
others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable.

For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their
decisions. These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the
Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at the Sprint Review.

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may
represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting
to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product
Owner.

#### Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum
Guide. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice,
both within the Scrum Team and the organization.

The Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Team’s effectiveness. They do
this by enabling the Scrum Team to improve its practices, within the Scrum
framework.

Scrum Masters are true leaders who serve the Scrum Team and the larger
organization.

The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including:

* Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality;
* Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the
  Definition of Done;
* Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress; and,
* Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and
  kept within the timebox.

The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:

* Helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product
  Backlog management;
* Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product
  Backlog items;
* Helping establish empirical product planning for a complex environment; and,
* Facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.

The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:

* Leading, training, and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption;
* Planning and advising Scrum implementations within the organization;
* Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach
  for complex work; and,
* Removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.

### Your Factor

Roll 1d4+1 (or just pick a number 2-5) for your factor. At 5 you are one with
the machine and don't want to deal with these meat bags; at 2 computers may
hate you but people never will.

### Bonds and Goals

Your team isn't brand new, some of you have been working together for a while,
some of you may be new to the team but have been at the company for a while,
some of you are new to both but you got hired for a reason. The Facilitator
will ask you some background questions about your character and the team to
help establish what all is going on. Spend a few minutes thinking about some
possible answers you may give.

## Rolling Dice

When you do something risky, roll 1d6 to find out how it goes. Add an extra die
(+1d) if you've prepared, and +1d if you're an expert (your Facilitator will
tell you how many dice to roll). Roll your dice and compare each die to your
number.

* If you've got a  *high* factor, you want to roll *under* your number.
* If you've got a *low* factor, you want to roll *over* your number.

0. If none of your die succeed, it went wrong. The Facilitator tells you how
   things just got worse.
1. If one die succeeds, you barely manage it, The Facilitator will tell you
   what complicated the outcome.
2. If two dice succeed, you can take satisfaction in a job well done.
3. If three or more dice succeed, you get a critical success! The Facilitator
   will tell you how much easier things become.

If you roll your number exactly, Jackpot! You get to ask the Facilitator a
question about what's going on. They'll answer you honestly. Some Good
Questions: Why do they really want ___? How can I get them to ___? What's the
best way to ___? What's really going on here?

A Jackpot roll counts as a success.

### Helping

If you want to help another player, tell the facilitator how you want to help.
They'll have you roll 1d6, if you have a relevant bond with the character they
may have you add +1d, and if you are successful you can give the other player
+1d. If they are successful, add a bond to both of your characters inspired by
the outcome.

### Die of Fate

Ocassionally the facilitator may roll a die (1d6) to determine some randomness
in the world. Maybe a vendor had an outage, possibly a key resource caught the
flu, maybe there is just a fly in your chardonay; the facilitator will let you
know.

## Facilitators

Your job as a Facilitator is to fill in the world around the characters, to
give the characters chances to make meaningful choices, and to enable everyone
to play to find out what happens.

[TK: these numbers are entirely made up and based on notes for a DW one-shot,
we should revise this when we understand the numbers better]

A typical session will take about 4 hours and break down like this:

0:00 Intro: talk about RPGs and Psychological Safety etc. Begin character
     building and Q&A.
0:30 Q&A complete, characters, setting and premise should be ready. Start with
2:15 1st and 2nd scenes complete, take a 15 minute bio break.
2:30 Final scene begins
3:45 Final scene complete, have a short debrief with the players and thank them
     for coming

### A Word about Psychological Safety

Psychological safety is being able to show and employ one's full self without
fear of negative consequences to self-image, status, or career. It is a shared
belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking. Studies (see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety#Current_research) have shown
that one of if not the most important factor in team success is psychological
safety.

Role-playing is a form of simulation, and simulation wouldn't be effective if
it didn't trigger at least some of the same processes that we expect to see in
the real world. Psychological Safety is just as important in Role-playing as it
is in a professional setting, however with role-playing it's difficult to tell
when a character is having a problem or when the player is. Sometimes it's
difficult for the player themselves to know.

Spend a few minutes discussing Psychological Safety with the players and how
you as a group will deal with situations before they arise.

A really good discussion of this for roleplaying in general can be found at
https://leavingmundania.com/2014/02/27/primer-safety-in-roleplaying-games/

### The Intro

Start by reading the premise. Talk to them about Psychological safety a bit.
Then tell them that together you'll figure out the dynamics of the team and the
specific details of the company as they create their characters.

Players will pick their characters based on the rules outlined in
__Characters__, they won't have the Bonds and Goals set just yet. **Do not go
around the table and have them introduce their characters.** We will learn
about them as we learn about their relationship to the company and each other.

### Q&A

This is the most important part of the intro time. This is where we generate
the setting, the premises, and the bonds. This is where we build the team, the
role playing group.

[TK discuss trying to find the implied questions in a sceanario? ]

#### General Principles of Q&A

All questions should be to a specific character, not to the table as a whole.
Asking the table just invites everyone to talk over each other and the more
gregarious tend to overshadow the more reserved or shy. We want everyone to
participate, so make sure to spread the questions evenly around the table.

The facilitator leads the Q&A but everyone is welcome to add to the
conversation.

Use multiple questions around a single topic to generate nuance in the setting
and create different, perhaps contradictory goals for the characters. Think
about the blind men and the elephant and how different people see different
parts of the whole.

Keep asking questions until the premise is clear and every character has a
connection to at least one goal. It's totally acceptable to ask leading
questions to achieve an element you know should be in the game like: Product
Owner, why does your company keep losing sales to an internet startup that
hasn't even gotten it's seed round of funding yet?

#### Setting Questions

Ask one of these questions to get the baseline of the setting down. It's easy
to start with the Product Owner if you have one:

* Product Owner, what product are you responsible for? How does it add to the
  company's bottom line?
* Scrum Master, what's the structure of the company? How does this help the
  company's revenue?
* Developer what's the code base like, is it brand new or is there technical
  debt? How about the systems it interacts with?
* Anyone how does your company earn revenue? How does your team fit into that?

You can ask follow up questions if you want some nuance:

* Scrum master, how many layers are there between a team member and the CEO?
* Product Owner, what story is highest on your backlog? Why?

#### Goal Questions

[TK: hook questions from https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2020/04/my-recipe-for-starting-adventures.html?m=1 ]

Goal generation is the most critical part of the setup. It's best to have
several distinct goals, especially with four or more players, they'll often
tangle up in interesting ways by the final scene.

Here are some basic questions that will establish premise:

* Product Owner if there was one product you know would make the company
  revenue what would it be?
* Scrum Master if you had a magic wand, what changes to the company would you
  make to improve the team's output?
* Developer if there was one change in your workflow that would improve
  everything, what would it be?
* Anyone what's the biggest challenge to getting work done at the company?

Once you've established some goals, it's time to tangle the party into them.
Draw a triangle between two characters and the premise and illustrate some
challenges.

<Facilitator> Product Owner if there was one product you know would make the
company revenue what would it be?
<PO> I think if we made more blue widgets, they'd sell like crazy.
<F> Developer, what's stopping us from making blue widgets?
<f> Scrum Master, what other teams will be impacted by trying to develop blue
widgets? Who needs to sign off on it? Why do you think they won't sign off?

Once you have a set of goals for each character and some challenges to them,
you should be ready to move on.

#### Bonds

After you have enough Q& to establish the company, the goals of the teams, and
some of their challenges, ask each character to write one Bond. If they need a
little prompting here are some questions you can ask that address standard
Bonds:

* Product Owner who here saved a project for you? How?
* Scrum Master who's estimates do you trust most? Why?
* Developer when you or they first joined the team, who were you most excited
  to work with? Why?
* Product Owner if you were to start your own company, who would you take with
  you?

### Running the Game

Your agenda as the facilitator:

* Play to find out what happens
* Fill the character's lives with meaningful choices
* Portray a realistic world

Here's a little script to get started with the main scene:

    Agile World is a conversation. Something may happen in the conversation
    that triggers rules and dice rolling. At first I'll call out when those
    happen, but as you become more familiar with the rules feel free to call
    them out yourselves.

Introduce the scene and tell them that the Company has decided that the first
goal needs to be achieved in 3 weeks. Remember to emphasise some of the
challenges they identified, ask "What do you do?"

Call for a roll when the situation is uncertain. Don't pre-plan outcomes. Let
failures push the actions forward. Remember you're trying to give them
meaningful choices not keep them from achieving their goals.

Ask questions and build on the answer. "Have any of you ever encountered this
problem before? When? How did that work out?"
